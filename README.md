# ModolaJS

Modola â€” a statically-typed dialect of JavaScript 
focused on strict, readable OOP, operator overloading, 
and developer-friendly tooling.

Modola code is transpiled to pure JavaScript, 
enabling seamless cross-platform execution 
and integration across different environments 
and industries.
